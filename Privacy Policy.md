Our Service is not directed to individuals under the age of 18 ("Children" or "Minors").

We do not knowingly collect, use, or share personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are under 18, please do not use our Service or provide any personal information to us.

**Parental Notice:**
If you are a parent or legal guardian and believe that your child under 18 has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us immediately at franc200078@gmail.com. Upon verification, we will take prompt steps to delete such information from our servers and terminate the child's account.

**Firebase Authentication Age Restrictions:**
Firebase's terms of service prohibit account creation for users under 13 (or applicable age in your jurisdiction). If we discover an underage account, it will be immediately terminated and all data deleted in compliance with COPPA regulations.

## 15. Analytics and Advertising

**Analytics Services:**
We use third-party analytics services to understand how users interact with our Service:

- **Google Analytics / Firebase Analytics**: Tracks user behavior, app performance, and usage patterns. You can opt-out of Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
- **Crash Reporting**: Automatically collects crash reports and diagnostic information to improve app stability.

**Advertising (If Applicable):**
If our Service displays advertisements, we may work with advertising partners who use cookies and similar technologies to deliver relevant ads. These partners may collect information about your device, usage patterns, and interactions with ads.

You may opt-out of personalized advertising by:

- Opting out of Google Analytics: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout

**Firebase Analytics Privacy:**
Firebase Analytics automatically respects user privacy choices and GDPR requirements. Analytics data is aggregated and anonymized, making it impossible to identify individual users in reports.

## 16. Automated Decision-Making and Profiling

We may use automated processing and algorithms to:

- Provide personalized content recommendations based on your reading history
- Suggest manga titles that match your preferences
- Optimize app performance and loading times

These automated decisions do not produce legal or similarly significant effects. You can request human review of automated decisions by contacting us.

## 17. Application-Specific Features

While this Privacy Policy applies uniformly to all CFMC DevWorks applications, certain apps may have unique features that collect additional data types:

### SineManga:

- Manga reading history and progress tracking
- Bookmarked titles and reading lists
- Chapter downloads (stored locally on device)
- Reading preferences (page layout, brightness, reading direction)
- Community interactions (comments, ratings on manga titles)

### Future CFMC DevWorks Applications:

As we release new applications on Google Play Console, this policy will govern their data practices. App-specific features and data collection will be disclosed:

- Within the app during onboarding
- In the Google Play Store app description
- Through in-app notifications for existing users

**Unified Account System:**
All CFMC DevWorks applications share the same Firebase-based account system. This means:

- ✅ **Single Sign-On**: Log in once, access all CFMC DevWorks apps
- ✅ **Unified Profile**: Same account info across all apps
- ✅ **Centralized Control**: Manage privacy settings from any app
- ⚠️ **Shared Deletion**: Deleting your account affects all apps

**App-Specific Data Isolation:**
While your account is shared, app-specific data remains separate:

- Data from SineManga is not accessible to other CFMC DevWorks apps
- Each app has its own database with isolated access controls
- Deleting one app doesn't delete data from other apps (unless you delete your entire account)

## 18. Links to Other Sites

Our Service may contain links to third-party websites, manga content sources, or services that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site.

We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

Links to external sites do not constitute an endorsement of those sites or their content.

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.

**Policy Updates Across Multiple Apps:**
When we update this Privacy Policy:

- Changes apply to ALL CFMC DevWorks applications simultaneously
- You'll be notified in each app you use
- The same effective date applies across all apps
