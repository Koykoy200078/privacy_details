# Account Deletion Policy

**Last Updated:** December 24, 2025  
**Applies to:** All CFMC applications on Google Play Console

---

## Overview

**User accounts are managed securely through Firebase Authentication.** You have full control over your account and can delete it at any time across all CFMC applications (including SineManga and any other CFMC apps you use).

---

## ⚠️ Important Notice: Multi-App Account

**Your CFMC account is shared across ALL our applications.** Deleting your account in one app (e.g., SineManga) will permanently delete it from ALL CFMC apps. This action cannot be undone.

2. Navigate to: **Settings** → **Account Settings** → **Delete Account**

4. Confirm your decision by authenticating your identity
5. Your account will be permanently deleted within **24 hours**

**Apps where you can delete:**
